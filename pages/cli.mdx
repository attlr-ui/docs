# Attlr CLI Usage Guide

The Attlr CLI provides a convenient way to manage the installation of Attlr UI Components in your React Native projects. Below is a guide on how to use the available commands:

## Usage

### Use via npx

```bash copy
npx attlr <command> [options]
```

## Commands

The Attlr CLI supports the following commands:

### 1. init

Use the `init` command to add Attlr to your project.

```bash copy
attlr init
```

This command will initialize Attlr in your project, setting up the necessary configurations.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This command should be run in the root directory of your project, and it will create a `attlr.config.json` file in the root directory of your project. If the file already exists, it will throw an error.
</Callout>


### 2. add

- `a` | `i` | `install`

The `add` command allows you to add a specific component (multiple components comming soon) to your project.

```bash copy
attlr add <component>
```

Replace `<component>`, with the names of the components you want to add. This command will install the specified components into your project.


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If the component already exists in your project, it will promt you to overwrite the existing component.
</Callout>

### 3. list

- `ls`

The `list` command is used to list the available components.

```bash copy
attlr list
```

This command will display a list of all available components.



## Examples

### Initialize Attlr in a Project

```bash copy
attlr init
```

### Add Specific Components

```bash copy
attlr add abutton
```

### List Available Components

```bash copy
attlr list
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have npm or yarn installed in your project before using the Attlr CLI.
- The `remove` command is not yet implemented and will be available in future updates.
- The `add` command currently only supports adding one component at a time. Support for adding multiple components will be available in future updates.
- The `init` command will create a `attlr.config.json` file in the root directory of your project. If the file already exists, it will throw an error.
